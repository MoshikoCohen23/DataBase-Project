The project deals with business analysis of data from a site for selling skates. The main business process that appears on the website is the purchase of various types of skates and related products.

The repository contains 3 file types:

1. Excel that containing ERD Data table.
2. PowerBI file with the all dashboards and analytical reports.
3. PDF file report summarizing the project objective, KPI's, conclusions and screenshots.
